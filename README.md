# TrailApp
A UWP app that will display local hiking and recreation trails to the user.
Right now this is in a very early stage. To use it, run it on a Windows 10 device. 
Click on get location, this will get your current location. After giving permission to location wait for 5 seconds. (will fix this in updates)
Then click find trails at the bottom of the app. This will display buttons that have the trails names on them. Plan to implement these buttons to open a trail details page.
